"""General vector classes, not coordinate system-specific.

These modules provide a variety of general-purpose vector classes. These
classes do not assume any particular coordinate system. These classes are
built on top of Numpy, and so objects created from these classes should be
usable wherever a Numpy ndarray object is usable.

Modules
-------
vector.py
vector2d.py
vector3d.py

Packages
